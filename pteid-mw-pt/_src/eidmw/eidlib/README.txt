============================C++ SDK===========================================
The files "pteidlib.lib" and respective header file "eidlib.h" contain the Portuguese eID C++ SDK 
hence should be loaded when developing applications that access the Portuguese Identity Card  

The file "eidlibcompat.h" contains the backwards compatibility API
and should NOT be used for developing new applications.
